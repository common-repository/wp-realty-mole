### [DEMO THE RENT ANALYSIS FOR PROPERTY MANAGERS PLUGIN HERE](http://realtymole.net/wordpress)

The Rent Analysis Plugin for Property Managers is powered by the [Realty Mole Rent Estimate API](https://rapidapi.com/moneals/api/rent-estimate) and provides accurate, up-to-date rent estimates for properties of any type - along with  comparable properties, pictures, and geo location. The plugin can be configured to require the user's email address to generate a rental report - future updates will allow the plugin to integrate with your quote and sales lead system.
